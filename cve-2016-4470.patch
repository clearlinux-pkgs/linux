Subject: KEYS: potential uninitialized variable

If __key_link_begin() failed then "edit" would be uninitialized.  I've
added a check to fix that.

This allows a random user to crash the kernel, though it's quite
difficult to achieve.  There are three ways it can be done as the user
would have to cause an error to occur in __key_link():

 (1) Cause the kernel to run out of memory.  In practice, this is difficult
     to achieve without ENOMEM cropping up elsewhere and aborting the
     attempt.

 (2) Revoke the destination keyring between the keyring ID being looked up
     and it being tested for revocation.  In practice, this is difficult to
     time correctly because the KEYCTL_REJECT function can only be used
     from the request-key upcall process.  Further, users can only make use
     of what's in /sbin/request-key.conf, though this does including a
     rejection debugging test - which means that the destination keyring
     has to be the caller's session keyring in practice.

 (3) Have just enough key quota available to create a key, a new session
     keyring for the upcall and a link in the session keyring, but not then
     sufficient quota to create a link in the nominated destination keyring
     so that it fails with EDQUOT.

The bug can be triggered using option (3) above using something like the
following:

	echo 80 >/proc/sys/kernel/keys/root_maxbytes
	keyctl request2 user debug:fred negate @t

The above sets the quota to something much lower (80) to make the bug
easier to trigger, but this is dependent on the system.  Note also that
the name of the keyring created contains a random number that may be
between 1 and 10 characters in size, so may throw the test off by
changing the amount of quota used.

Assuming the failure occurs, something like the following will be seen:
