Subject: [PATCH 01/18] x86/msr: Add the IA32_TSX_CTRL MSR

commit c2955f270a84762343000f103e0640d29c7a96f3 upstream

Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX) may be used on certain
processors as part of a speculative side channel attack.  A microcode
update for existing processors that are vulnerable to this attack will
add a new MSR - IA32_TSX_CTRL to allow the system administrator the
option to disable TSX as one of the possible mitigations.

The CPUs which get this new MSR after a microcode upgrade are the ones
which do not set MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES.MDS_NO (bit 5) because those
CPUs have CPUID.MD_CLEAR, i.e., the VERW implementation which clears all
CPU buffers takes care of the TAA case as well.

  [ Note that future processors that are not vulnerable will also
    support the IA32_TSX_CTRL MSR. ]

Add defines for the new IA32_TSX_CTRL MSR and its bits.

TSX has two sub-features:

1. Restricted Transactional Memory (RTM) is an explicitly-used feature
   where new instructions begin and end TSX transactions.
2. Hardware Lock Elision (HLE) is implicitly used when certain kinds of
   "old" style locks are used by software.

Bit 7 of the IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES indicates the presence of the
IA32_TSX_CTRL MSR.

There are two control bits in IA32_TSX_CTRL MSR:

  Bit 0: When set, it disables the Restricted Transactional Memory (RTM)
         sub-feature of TSX (will force all transactions to abort on the
	 XBEGIN instruction).

  Bit 1: When set, it disables the enumeration of the RTM and HLE feature
         (i.e. it will make CPUID(EAX=7).EBX{bit4} and
	  CPUID(EAX=7).EBX{bit11} read as 0).

The other TSX sub-feature, Hardware Lock Elision (HLE), is
unconditionally disabled by the new microcode but still enumerated
as present by CPUID(EAX=7).EBX{bit4}, unless disabled by
IA32_TSX_CTRL_MSR[1] - TSX_CTRL_CPUID_CLEAR.
