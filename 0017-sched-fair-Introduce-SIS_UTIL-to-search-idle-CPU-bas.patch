Subject: [PATCH 17/32] sched/fair: Introduce SIS_UTIL to search idle CPU based
 on sum of util_avg

[Problem Statement]
select_idle_cpu() might spend too much time searching for an idle CPU,
when the system is overloaded.

The following histogram is the time spent in select_idle_cpu(),
when running 224 instances of netperf on a system with 112 CPUs
per LLC domain:

The time spent in select_idle_cpu() is visible to netperf and might have a negative
impact.

[Symptom analysis]
The patch [1] from Mel Gorman has been applied to track the efficiency
of select_idle_sibling. Copy the indicators here:

SIS Search Efficiency(se_eff%):
        A ratio expressed as a percentage of runqueues scanned versus
        idle CPUs found. A 100% efficiency indicates that the target,
        prev or recent CPU of a task was idle at wakeup. The lower the
        efficiency, the more runqueues were scanned before an idle CPU
        was found.

SIS Domain Search Efficiency(dom_eff%):
        Similar, except only for the slower SIS
	patch.

SIS Fast Success Rate(fast_rate%):
        Percentage of SIS that used target, prev or
	recent CPUs.

SIS Success rate(success_rate%):
        Percentage of scans that found an idle CPU.

The test is based on Aubrey's schedtests tool, including netperf, hackbench,
schbench and tbench.

According to the test above, if the system becomes busy, the
SIS Search Efficiency(se_eff%) drops significantly. Although some
benchmarks would finally find an idle CPU(success_rate% = 100%), it is
doubtful whether it is worth it to search the whole LLC domain.

[Proposal]
It would be ideal to have a crystal ball to answer this question:
How many CPUs must a wakeup path walk down, before it can find an idle
CPU? Many potential metrics could be used to predict the number.
One candidate is the sum of util_avg in this LLC domain. The benefit
of choosing util_avg is that it is a metric of accumulated historic
activity, which seems to be smoother than instantaneous metrics
(such as rq->nr_running). Besides, choosing the sum of util_avg
would help predict the load of the LLC domain more precisely, because
SIS_PROP uses one CPU's idle time to estimate the total LLC domain idle
time.

In summary, the lower the util_avg is, the more select_idle_cpu()
should scan for idle CPU, and vice versa. When the sum of util_avg
in this LLC domain hits 85% or above, the scan stops. The reason to
choose 85% as the threshold is that this is the imbalance_pct(117)
when a LLC sched group is overloaded.

Introduce the quadratic function:

y = SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE - p * x^2
and y'= y / SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE

x is the ratio of sum_util compared to the CPU capacity:
x = sum_util / (llc_weight * SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE)
y' is the ratio of CPUs to be scanned in the LLC domain,
and the number of CPUs to scan is calculated by:

nr_scan = llc_weight * y'

Choosing quadratic function is because:
[1] Compared to the linear function, it scans more aggressively when the
    sum_util is low.
[2] Compared to the exponential function, it is easier to calculate.
[3] It seems that there is no accurate mapping between the sum of util_avg
    and the number of CPUs to be scanned. Use heuristic scan for now.

For a platform with 112 CPUs per LLC, the number of CPUs to scan is:
sum_util%   0    5   15   25  35  45  55   65   75   85   86 ...
scan_nr   112  111  108  102  93  81  65   47   25    1    0 ...

For a platform with 16 CPUs per LLC, the number of CPUs to scan is:
sum_util%   0    5   15   25  35  45  55   65   75   85   86 ...
scan_nr    16   15   15   14  13  11   9    6    3    0    0 ...

Furthermore, to minimize the overhead of calculating the metrics in
select_idle_cpu(), borrow the statistics from periodic load balance.
As mentioned by Abel, on a platform with 112 CPUs per LLC, the
sum_util calculated by periodic load balance after 112 ms would
decay to about 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.7 = 8.75%, thus bringing a delay
in reflecting the latest utilization. But it is a trade-off.
Checking the util_avg in newidle load balance would be more frequent,
but it brings overhead - multiple CPUs write/read the per-LLC shared
variable and introduces cache contention. Tim also mentioned that,
it is allowed to be non-optimal in terms of scheduling for the
short-term variations, but if there is a long-term trend in the load
behavior, the scheduler can adjust for that.

When SIS_UTIL is enabled, the select_idle_cpu() uses the nr_scan
calculated by SIS_UTIL instead of the one from SIS_PROP. As Peter and
Mel suggested, SIS_UTIL should be enabled by default.

This patch is based on the util_avg, which is very sensitive to the
CPU frequency invariance. There is an issue that, when the max frequency
has been clamp, the util_avg would decay insanely fast when
the CPU is idle. Commit addca285120b ("cpufreq: intel_pstate: Handle no_turbo
in frequency invariance") could be used to mitigate this symptom, by adjusting
the arch_max_freq_ratio when turbo is disabled. But this issue is still
not thoroughly fixed, because the current code is unaware of the user-specified
max CPU frequency.

[Test result]

netperf and tbench were launched with 25% 50% 75% 100% 125% 150%
175% 200% of CPU number respectively. Hackbench and schbench were launched
by 1, 2 ,4, 8 groups. Each test lasts for 100 seconds and repeats 3 times.

The following is the benchmark result comparison between
baseline:vanilla v5.19-rc1 and compare:patched kernel. Positive compare%
indicates better performance.

Each netperf test is a:

Take the 224 threads as an example, the SIS search metrics changes are
illustrated below:

   5842896          +162.7%   15347978        sched_debug.cpu.sis_search.avg

There is -87.9% less CPU scans after patched, which indicates lower overhead.
Besides, with this patch applied, there is -13% less rq lock contention
in perf-profile.calltrace.cycles-pp._raw_spin_lock.raw_spin_rq_lock_nested
.try_to_wake_up.default_wake_function.woken_wake_function.
This might help explain the performance improvement - Because this patch allows
the waking task to remain on the previous CPU, rather than grabbing other CPUs'
lock.

*Consider the Standard Deviation, this -7.36% regression might not be valid.

Also, a OLTP workload with a commercial RDBMS has been tested, and there
is no significant change.

There were concerns that unbalanced tasks among CPUs would cause problems.
For example, suppose the LLC domain is composed of 8 CPUs, and 7 tasks are
bound to CPU0~CPU6, while CPU7 is idle:

          CPU0    CPU1    CPU2    CPU3    CPU4    CPU5    CPU6    CPU7
util_avg  1024    1024    1024    1024    1024    1024    1024    0

Since the util_avg ratio is 87.5%( = 7/8 ), which is higher than 85%,
select_idle_cpu() will not scan, thus CPU7 is undetected during scan.
But according to Mel, it is unlikely the CPU7 will be idle all the time
because CPU7 could pull some tasks via CPU_NEWLY_IDLE.

lkp(kernel test robot) has reported a regression on stress-ng.sock on a
very busy system. According to the sched_debug statistics, it might be caused
by SIS_UTIL terminates the scan and chooses a previous CPU earlier, and this
might introduce more context switch, especially involuntary preemption, which
impacts a busy stress-ng. This regression has shown that, not all benchmarks
in every scenario benefit from idle CPU scan limit, and it needs further
investigation.

Besides, there is slight regression in hackbench's 16 groups case when the
LLC domain has 16 CPUs. Prateek mentioned that we should scan aggressively
in an LLC domain with 16 CPUs. Because the cost to search for an idle one
among 16 CPUs is negligible. The current patch aims to propose a generic
solution and only considers the util_avg. Something like the below could
be applied on top of the current patch to fulfill the requirement:

	if (llc_weight <= 16)
		nr_scan = nr_scan * 32 / llc_weight;

For LLC domain with 16 CPUs, the nr_scan will be expanded to 2 times large.
The smaller the CPU number this LLC domain has, the larger nr_scan will be
expanded. This needs further investigation.

There is also ongoing work[2] from Abel to filter out the busy CPUs during
wakeup, to further speed up the idle CPU scan. And it could be a following-up
optimization on top of this change.
