Subject: [PATCH 09/13] cpuidle,x86: increase forced cut-off for polling to
 20us

The cpuidle menu governor has a forced cut-off for polling at 5us,
in order to deal with firmware that gives the OS bad information
on cpuidle states, leading to the system spending way too much time
in polling.

However, at least one x86 CPU family (Atom) has chips that have
a 20us break-even point for C1. Forcing the polling cut-off to
less than that wastes performance and power.

Increase the polling cut-off to 20us.

Systems with a lower C1 latency will be found in the states table by
the menu governor, which will pick those states as appropriate.
