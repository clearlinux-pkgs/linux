atomic_t based reference counting, including refcount_t, uses
atomic_inc_not_zero() for acquiring a reference. atomic_inc_not_zero() is
implemented with a atomic_try_cmpxchg() loop. High contention of the
reference count leads to retry loops and scales badly. There is nothing to
improve on this implementation as the semantics have to be preserved.

Provide rcuref as a scalable alternative solution which is suitable for RCU
managed objects. Similar to refcount_t it comes with overflow and underflow
detection and mitigation.

rcuref treats the underlying atomic_t as an unsigned integer and partitions
this space into zones:

  0x00000000 - 0x7FFFFFFF	valid zone
  0x80000000 - 0xBFFFFFFF	saturation zone
  0xC0000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF	dead zone

rcuref_get() unconditionally increments the reference count with
atomic_fetch_add_relaxed(). rcuref_put() unconditionally decrements the
reference count with atomic_fetch_sub_relaxed().

This unconditional increment avoids the inc_not_zero() problem, but
requires a more complex implementation on the put() side when the count
drops from 1 to 0.

When this transition is detected then it is attempted to mark the reference
count dead, by setting it to the midpoint of the dead zone with a single
atomic_cmpxchg_release() operation. This operation can fail due to a
concurrent rcuref_get() elevating the reference count from 0 to 1.

If the unconditional increment in rcuref_get() hits a reference count which
is marked dead (or saturated) it will detect it after the fact and bring
back the reference count to the midpoint of the respective zone. The zones
provide enough tolerance which makes it practically impossible to escape
from a zone.

The racy implementation of rcuref_put() requires to protect rcuref_put()
against a grace period ending in order to prevent a subtle use after
free. As RCU is the only mechanism which allows to protect against that, it
is not possible to replace the atomic_inc_not_zero() based implementation
of refcount_t with this scheme.

The final drop is slightly more expensive than the atomic_dec_return()
counterpart, but that's not the case which this is optimized for. The
optimization is on the high frequeunt get()/put() pairs and their
scalability.

The performance of an uncontended rcuref_get()/put() pair where the put()
is not dropping the last reference is still on par with the plain atomic
operations, while at the same time providing overflow and underflow
detection and mitigation.

The performance of rcuref compared to plain atomic_inc_not_zero() and
atomic_dec_return() based reference counting under contention:

 -  Micro benchmark: All CPUs running a increment/decrement loop on an
    elevated reference count, which means the 1 to 0 transition never
    happens.

    The performance gain depends on microarchitecture and the number of
    CPUs and has been observed in the range of 1.3X to 4.7X

 - Conversion of dst_entry::__refcnt to rcuref and testing with the
    localhost memtier/memcached benchmark. That benchmark shows the
    reference count contention prominently.
    
    The performance gain depends on microarchitecture and the number of
    CPUs and has been observed in the range of 1.1X to 2.6X over the
    previous fix for the false sharing issue vs. struct
    dst_entry::__refcnt.

    When memtier is run over a real 1Gb network connection, there is a
    small gain on top of the false sharing fix. The two changes combined
    result in a 2%-5% total gain for that networked test.

+/*
+ * rcuref - A scalable reference count implementation for RCU managed objects
+ *
+ * rcuref is provided to replace open coded reference count implementations
+ * based on atomic_t. It protects explicitely RCU managed objects which can
+ * be visible even after the last reference has been dropped and the object
+ * is heading towards destruction.
+ *
+ * A common usage pattern is:
+ *
+ * get()
+ *	rcu_read_lock();
+ *	p = get_ptr();
+ *	if (p && !atomic_inc_not_zero(&p->refcnt))
+ *		p = NULL;
+ *	rcu_read_unlock();
+ *	return p;
+ *
+ * put()
+ *	if (!atomic_dec_return(&->refcnt)) {
+ *		remove_ptr(p);
+ *		kfree_rcu((p, rcu);
+ *	}
+ *
+ * atomic_inc_not_zero() is implemented with a try_cmpxchg() loop which has
+ * O(N^2) behaviour under contention with N concurrent operations.
+ *
+ * rcuref uses atomic_fetch_add_relaxed() and atomic_fetch_sub_release()
+ * for the fast path, which scale better under contention.
+ *
+ * Why not refcount?
+ * =================
+ *
+ * In principle it should be possible to make refcount use the rcuref
+ * scheme, but the destruction race described below cannot be prevented
+ * unless the protected object is RCU managed.
+ *
+ * Theory of operation
+ * ===================
+ *
+ * rcuref uses an unsigned integer reference counter. As long as the
+ * counter value is greater than or equal to RCUREF_ONEREF and not larger
+ * than RCUREF_MAXREF the reference is alive:
+ *
+ * NOREF ONEREF   MAXREF             SATURATED             RELEASED      DEAD
+ * 0     1      0x7FFFFFFF 0x8000000 0xA0000000 0xBFFFFFFF 0xC0000000 0xE0000000 0xFFFFFFFF
+ * <---valid ------------> <-------saturation zone-------> <-----------dead zone---------->
+ *
+ * The get() and put() operations do unconditional increments and
+ * decrements. The result is checked after the operation. This optimizes
+ * for the fast path.
+ *
+ * If the reference count is saturated or dead, then the increments and
+ * decrements are not harmful as the reference count still stays in the
+ * respective zones and is always set back to STATURATED resp. DEAD. The
+ * zones have room for 2^28 racing operations in each direction, which
+ * makes it practically impossible to escape the zones.
+ *
+ * Once the last reference is dropped the reference count becomes
+ * RCUREF_NOREF which forces rcuref_put() into the slowpath operation. The
+ * slowpath then tries to set the reference count from RCUREF_NOREF to
+ * RCUREF_DEAD via a cmpxchg(). This opens a small window where a
+ * concurrent rcuref_get() can acquire the reference count and bring it
+ * back to RCUREF_ONEREF or even drop the reference again and mark it DEAD.
+ *
+ * If the cmpxchg() succeeds then a concurrent rcuref_get() will result in
+ * DEAD + 1, which is inside the dead zone. If that happens the reference
+ * count is put back to DEAD.
+ *
+ * The actual race is possible due to the unconditional increment and
+ * decrements in rcuref_get() and rcuref_put():
+ *
+ *	T1				T2
+ *	get()				put()
+ *					if (atomic_fetch_sub(1, &ref->refcnt) >= 0)
+ *		succeeds->			atomic_try_cmpxchg(&ref->refcnt, -1, DEAD);
+ *
+ *	old = atomic_fetch_add(1, &ref->refcnt);	<- Elevates refcount to DEAD + 1
+ *
+ * As @old observed by T1 is within the dead zone the T1 get() fails.
+ *
+ * Possible critical states:
+ *
+ *	Context Counter	References	Operation
+ *	T1	1	1		init()
+ *	T2	2	2		get()
+ *	T1	1	1		put()
+ *	T2      0	0		put() tries to mark dead
+ *	T1	1	1		get()
+ *	T2	1	1		put() mark dead fails
+ *	T1      0	0		put() tries to mark dead
+ *	T1    DEAD	0		put() mark dead succeeds
+ *	T2    DEAD+1	0		get() fails and puts it back to DEAD
+ *
+ * Of course there are more complex scenarios, but the above illustrates
+ * the working principle. The rest is left to the imagination of the
+ * reader.
+ *
+ * Deconstruction race
+ * ===================
+ *
+ * The release operation must be protected by prohibiting a grace period in
+ * order to prevent a possible use after free:
+ *
+ *	T1				T2
+ *	put()				get()
+ *	// ref->refcnt = ONEREF
+ *	if (atomic_fetch_sub(1, &ref->cnt) > ONEREF)
+ *		return false;				<- Not taken
+ *
+ *	// ref->refcnt == NOREF
+ *	--> preemption
+ *					// Elevates ref->c to ONEREF
+ *					if (!atomic_fetch_add(1, &ref->refcnt) >= NOREF)
+ *						return true;			<- taken
+ *
+ *					if (put(&p->ref)) { <-- Succeeds
+ *						remove_pointer(p);
+ *						kfree_rcu(p, rcu);
+ *					}
+ *
+ *		RCU grace period ends, object is freed
+ *
+ *	atomic_cmpxchg(&ref->refcnt, NONE, DEAD);	<- UAF
+ *
+ * This is prevented by disabling preemption around the put() operation as
+ * that's in most kernel configurations cheaper than a rcu_read_lock() /
+ * rcu_read_unlock() pair and in many cases even a NOOP. In any case it
+ * prevents the grace period which keeps the object alive until all put()
+ * operations complete.
+ *
+ * Saturation protection
+ * =====================
+ *
+ * The reference count has a saturation limit RCUREF_MAXREF (INT_MAX).
+ * Once this is exceedded the reference count becomes stale by setting it
+ * to RCUREF_SATURATED, which will cause a memory leak, but it prevents
+ * wrap arounds which obviously cause worse problems than a memory
+ * leak. When saturation is reached a warning is emitted.
+ *
+ * Race conditions
+ * ===============
+ *
+ * All reference count increment/decrement operations are unconditional and
+ * only verified after the fact. This optimizes for the good case and takes
+ * the occasional race vs. a dead or already saturated refcount into
+ * account. The saturation and dead zones are large enough to accomodate
+ * for that.
+ *
+ * Memory ordering
+ * ===============
+ *
+ * Memory ordering rules are slightly relaxed wrt regular atomic_t functions
+ * and provide only what is strictly required for refcounts.
+ *
+ * The increments are fully relaxed; these will not provide ordering. The
+ * rationale is that whatever is used to obtain the object to increase the
+ * reference count on will provide the ordering. For locked data
+ * structures, its the lock acquire, for RCU/lockless data structures its
+ * the dependent load.
+ *
+ * rcuref_get() provides a control dependency ordering future stores which
+ * ensures that the object is not modified when acquiring a reference
+ * fails.
+ *
+ * rcuref_put() provides release order, i.e. all prior loads and stores
+ * will be issued before. It also provides a control dependency ordering
+ * against the subsequent destruction of the object.
+ *
+ * If rcuref_put() successfully dropped the last reference and marked the
+ * object DEAD it also provides acquire ordering.
