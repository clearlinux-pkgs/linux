Subject: [PATCH 110/121] init_task: faster timerslack

the default tuning is a compromise between client power and server performance;
for a server distro like Clear Linux, we don't need to compromise.
(for non-server usages we have different kernel binaries)

in principle this can be done as a patch to systemd as well, but we have a shared
systemd between usages while we have different kernels, so the logistics
for where the patch goes work out better here
