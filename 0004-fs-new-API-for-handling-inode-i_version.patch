Subject: [PATCH 04/22] fs: new API for handling inode->i_version

Add a documentation blob that explains what the i_version field is, how
it is expected to work, and how it is currently implemented by various
filesystems.

We already have inode_inc_iversion. Add several other functions for
manipulating and accessing the i_version counter. For now, the
implementation is trivial and basically works the way that all of the
open-coded i_version accesses work today.

Future patches will convert existing users of i_version to use the new
API, and then convert the backend implementation to do things more
efficiently.

+ * The change attribute (i_version) is mandated by NFSv4 and is mostly for
+ * knfsd, but is also used for other purposes (e.g. IMA). The i_version must
+ * appear different to observers if there was a change to the inode's data or
+ * metadata since it was last queried.
+ *
+ * Observers see the i_version as a 64-bit number that never decreases. If it
+ * remains the same since it was last checked, then nothing has changed in the
+ * inode. If it's different then something has changed. Observers cannot infer
+ * anything about the nature or magnitude of the changes from the value, only
+ * that the inode has changed in some fashion.
+ *
+ * Not all filesystems properly implement the i_version counter. Subsystems that
+ * want to use i_version field on an inode should first check whether the
+ * filesystem sets the SB_I_VERSION flag (usually via the IS_I_VERSION macro).
+ *
+ * Those that set SB_I_VERSION will automatically have their i_version counter
+ * incremented on writes to normal files. If the SB_I_VERSION is not set, then
+ * the VFS will not touch it on writes, and the filesystem can use it how it
+ * wishes. Note that the filesystem is always responsible for updating the
+ * i_version on namespace changes in directories (mkdir, rmdir, unlink, etc.).
+ * We consider these sorts of filesystems to have a kernel-managed i_version.
+ *
+ * It may be impractical for filesystems to keep i_version updates atomic with
+ * respect to the changes that cause them.  They should, however, guarantee
+ * that i_version updates are never visible before the changes that caused
+ * them.  Also, i_version updates should never be delayed longer than it takes
+ * the original change to reach disk.
+ *
+ * Note that some filesystems (e.g. NFS and AFS) just use the field to store
+ * a server-provided value (for the most part). For that reason, those
+ * filesystems do not set SB_I_VERSION. These filesystems are considered to
