Subject: [PATCH 02/32] sched/numa: Do not swap tasks between nodes when spare
 capacity is available

If a destination node has spare capacity but there is an imbalance then
two tasks are selected for swapping. If the tasks have no numa group
or are within the same NUMA group, it's simply shuffling tasks around
without having any impact on the compute imbalance. Instead, it's just
punishing one task to help another.
