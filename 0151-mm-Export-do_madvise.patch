Subject: [PATCH 151/154] mm: Export do_madvise()

Combined with some interesting flags madvise() system call
allows to free memory more smartly and more efficiently than
we could do with a simple free(). The issue is that is not
available for kernel modules that could need it.

In order to solve this lack of support, this patch exports
do_madvise() so as to make it available to the entire kernel.
The already existing madvise() system call is unchanged and
now relies on this new do_madvise() function.
